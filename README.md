## Security

This API implements several security measures, including:

- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests a client can make within a specified time frame.
- **Helmet Protection**: Adds various HTTP headers to enhance security.
- **XSS Protection**: Sanitizes user input to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
- **Data Sanitization**: Prevents NoSQL query injection by sanitizing user-supplied data.
- **CORS**: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to control which domains can access the API.
